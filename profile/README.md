# Voiced

**[Voice-to-text for Mac](https://www.voicedhq.com) that runs entirely on your device.**

## How it works

- **Hold a key and speak.** Voiced listens through your Mac's microphone.
- **Smart Cleanup** strips filler words ("um," "uh," "you know") and polishes punctuation automatically.
- **Text appears instantly** in whatever app you're using — Mail, Slack, Notion, VS Code, Terminal, anything.

## Key features
