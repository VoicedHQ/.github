# Voiced

**Voice-to-text for Mac that runs entirely on your device.**

Voiced is a dictation app for macOS that turns your speech into clean, polished text — in any app, offline, with zero cloud processing. Hold a key, talk, release. Your words appear wherever your cursor is.

## How it works

- **Hold a key and speak.** Voiced listens through your Mac's microphone.
- **Smart Cleanup** strips filler words ("um," "uh," "you know") and polishes punctuation automatically.
- **Text appears instantly** in whatever app you're using — Mail, Slack, Notion, VS Code, Terminal, anything.

## Key features

- **100% on-device** — Audio is processed locally using Apple's CoreML. Nothing is sent to any server, ever.
- **Works in any app** — System-wide dictation via accessibility. If you can type in it, you can dictate in it.
- **No timeout** — Talk for as long as you need. Pause to think. It keeps listening until you release the key.
- **No account required** — No sign-up, no API keys, no cloud services.
- **One-time purchase** — $40. No subscription.

## Requirements

- macOS Sonoma (14+)
- Apple Silicon (M1 or later)
